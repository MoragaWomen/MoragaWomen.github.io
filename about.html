			<h1>about us:</h1>
			<p>Moraga Women's Society is an organization founded over 45 years ago to provide service and funding for the betterment of the community. Since 1967 we have contributed over $370,000. A sizable portion of these funds have been donated to Moraga schools, our Park and Recreation Dept. and Moraga Schools. Our long history in our community has included such events as the bi-annual Holiday Homes Tour, the Artist Faire, and Appraisal Days with Michaan Auction House. We currently participate in the annual Pear Festival and will be holding our annual Games Day in the Fall of 2014. If you are looking for friendly women to work with while doing worthwhile projects for the community, fun socials and interesting guest speakers, then the Moraga Women's Society is for you. Our speakers are always interesting and diverse. In recent years speakers have included local authors such as Betty Iverson, Moraga's own Larry Swindell, the newscaster Patti Reising from KCBS, the nationally know flautist, Carol Alban, and our local supervisor Candice Andersen. Over the years we have had many fun as well as educational excursions. We have gone to the Oakland Museum, the California Academy of Science, Black Diamond Mines, and the Disney Museum in San Francisco. </p>
