				<h2 class="about">Who We Are</h2>
					<p>Moraga Women's Society is an organization founded over 45 years ago to provide service and funding for the betterment of the community. Since 1967 we have contributed over $370,000. A sizable portion of these funds have been donated to Moraga schools, our Park and Recreation Dept. and Moraga Schools. Our long history in our community has included such events as the bi-annual Holiday Homes Tour, the Artist Faire, and Appraisal Days with Michaan Auction House. If you are looking for friendly women to work with while doing worthwhile projects for the community, fun socials and interesting guest speakers, then the Moraga Women's Society is for you.</p>
